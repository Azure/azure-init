# Contribute to Azure Provisioning Agent

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

For each pull request, CI automatically runs unit tests by running `cargo test`, and also checks for coding styles and lints by running `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`. So please make sure that the all steps pass with the changes you made, `test`, `fmt`, and `clippy`, to avoid making CI fail with such issues.
